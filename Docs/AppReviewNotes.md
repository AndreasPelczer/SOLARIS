# App Review Notes – SOLARA

## What is SOLARA?

SOLARA is a satirical to-do app that parodies esoteric productivity tools. It assigns random "cosmic states" to tasks and occasionally refuses to complete them with humorous messages. The app is intended as lighthearted comedy, not as actual spiritual guidance.

## In-App Purchases

SOLARA offers **four consumable in-app purchases** in its "Cosmic Gift Shop":

| Product ID | Name | Type |
|---|---|---|
| solara.tea | Cosmic Tea | Consumable |
| solara.stone | Virtual Healing Stone | Consumable |
| solara.mercurykit | Mercury Retrograde Kit | Consumable |
| solara.patron | Cosmic Patronage | Consumable |

**Important:**
- All purchases are **entirely optional**. The app is fully functional without any purchase.
- Purchases provide **no functional benefit** whatsoever — no features are unlocked, no content is gated, no advantages are granted.
- This is clearly communicated to the user in the shop UI before purchase (see disclaimer text).
- There is **no "Restore Purchases" button** because all items are consumables with no persistent entitlement (per Apple's StoreKit guidelines).

## How to Find the Shop

1. Open the app → Home screen
2. Tap **"✦ Shop"** in the top-right navigation bar
3. The shop displays all four products with prices loaded from StoreKit

## Data & Privacy

- **No analytics, tracking, or third-party SDKs** are used.
- All task data is stored **locally on-device only**.
- No user data is collected, transmitted, or shared.

## Localization

The app is localized in four languages: German (source), English, Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese.
